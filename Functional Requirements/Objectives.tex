The main objectives of the benchmarking service is to provide an integrated platform:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For benchmarking source code from various languages.
	\item For benchmarking various types of software code such as data structures,
        artificial intelligence algorithms, common application code and various 
        other types of software code.
	\item Allowing users to compare the results of various benchmarks.
	\item To ease the management related to the generation, storing, cataloguing 
        of test data, algorithm source code and measurements made by the system.
\end{itemize}
