  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../Diagrams and Charts/User Management/Scope.jpg}
  \caption{Users Scope}
  \end{center}
  \label{Users Scope}
\end{figure}
The scope of the users module include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Administrator users can add and remove Regular Users
	\item Any person who wants use the benchmarking service can register
	to the system and become a user. They can then also edit

  \end{center}
  \label{Users Domain Model}
\end{figure}

There are 2 main types of users who are at different authority levels. 
\textit{Administrator} users will have the permissions needed to manage the 
website, manage regular users and do certain administrative duties on the
system.

\textit{Users} can be registered by anyone who wants to use the benchmarking 
service. These users will be able to conduct benchmarks but will not be able to
preform any administrative duties on the system.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Process Design}
Refer to figure \ref{fig:CreateUnmanagedUserProcessDesign} on the process flow to
create a new unmanaged user account, i.e. the end user creates there own account.
Note that the Get user With Authorities service is used to confirm if another
user with that same username already exists in the system, if so an DuplicateUsernameException
is raised. Next the Create Unmanaged User user is responsible for confirming that
no account is already associated with the email address passed in with the request
object. If email address is already associated with an account a EmailAlreadyExistsException
is raised. After the account has been created a notification will be sent to the
user. If email could not be sent to the user, a EmailNotSentException is raised.
