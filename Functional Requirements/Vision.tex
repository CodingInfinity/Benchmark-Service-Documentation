It is strange that although benchmarking seem to be a very common and useful application, very few benchmarking tools or services are available. Those that are available requires intricate configuration that may be beyond the reach of the developers, researchers,
teachers and students who would like to use them. The development of a benchmarking service which can be used in a generic way would therefore be welcomed by a large
potential user base.
