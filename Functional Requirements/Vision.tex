There are many cases in the industry, in research and in education where benchmarking of
a software product is important. In industry benchmarks can be used to ensure that soft-
ware performance is acceptable. In the competitive commercial world, benchmarks can
serve to inform buyers of comparative performance of competing products. The bench-
marking forms an integral part of research related to the development of new algorithms
and techniques as well as the refinement and optimization of existing operations. Algo-
rithm and data structure benchmarks can be applied as a very useful teaching tool for
students to review the notions of space and time complexity.\\ \\
