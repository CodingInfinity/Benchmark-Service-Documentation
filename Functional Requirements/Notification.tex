The \textit{Notification} module is currently used for sending notifications to
the user upon account creation or when the user tries to recover a lost account.
The module can however be expanded in future to allow other notification 
services and hence the decision to include this as a major module in the system
and not as a submodule of the User Management module.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope for the Notification modules is shown in Figure \ref{fig:notificationScope}.

	\end{center}	
\end{figure}

These use cases will be used by the User Management Module to assist with the
user authentication and recovering of lost accounts. The module however provides
general functionality to send emails which can be used by any other module that
may require this in future.

\subsection{Send Activation Email}
The \textit{Send Activation Email} use case is concerned with with sending
a new created managed user an email on how to setup there password. Important to
note is that the user's account has been activated as it was created by an
administrator, however the administrator should not have control off selecting a
password for the user as this will violate general security principles.

\subsubsection{Service Contract}
The service contract for sending an activation email upon account creation is 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:sendActivationEmailServiceContract}
