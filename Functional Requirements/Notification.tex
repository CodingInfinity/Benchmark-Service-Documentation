The \textit{Notification} module is responsible for keeping the user informed 
as to when the benchmarking on their work is done. this is in place because
results will often not be instant due to factors such as queues because of server
load or algorithm needing a large of time to be throughly benchmarked. Once the
benchmarking is completed, the user will be notified by email that they can now
view their results.
