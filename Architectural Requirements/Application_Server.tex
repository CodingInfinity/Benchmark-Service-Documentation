The application server provides the required execution environment for business
services to be deployed and executed within. The application server is responsible
for realizing the business layer.

\subsection{Architecture Requirements}
The architectural requirements include refined quality requirements and architecural
responsibilities. The applicatoin server however doesn't include additional
architecture constraints other than those specified in section \ref{sec:systemArchitecturalConstraints}

\subsubsection{Access and Integration Requirements}
The stated access and integration requirements in section \ref{sec:accessIntegrationRequirementsManagementSystem}
need to be propegated down to this lower level component. The application server
will be mainly responsible for exposing these channels realized by other lower
level components.

Further more stated quality requirements in section \ref{sec:qualityRequirementManagementSystem}
need to also be propegated down to this layer as much of the quality
requirements will realized by the application server. Further refinement of the
quality requirements is however provided.
