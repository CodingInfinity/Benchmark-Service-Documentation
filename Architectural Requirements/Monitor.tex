\subsubsection{Quality Requirements}
\paragraph{Flexibility}
The Monitor should designed in such a way that it can benchmark any program
written in any language. This includes programming and scripting languages.

\paragraph{Maintainability}
This section poses no further requirements than was mentioned in
section 4.1.1.2.3.

\paragraph{Performance}
The performance requirements of the Monitor program is that the benchmarking
it does should be accurate to a very high degree.

\subsubsection{Architectural Components}

\subsubsection{Frameworks and Technologies}
Native Linux performance measuring tools will be used to do the benchmarking.
This will be used in conjunction with existing performance measure programs
like valgrind for example. The exact way in which these will be combined is
up to the functional design of the project.
