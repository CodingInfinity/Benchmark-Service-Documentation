In this section we discuss architectural responsibilities which need to be addressed by the software
architecture. These include:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Providing a persistance infrastructure to be used
	\item Providing a reporing infrastructure that will genretate reports from the persistance infrastructure
	\item Providing a secured enviroment in which to execute the programs that need to be benchmarked.
	In this case there are security risks since we are allowing users to upload code to the server which
	will be executed. Here Docker will be used. The executable code will packaged in a docker container
	and sent to the execution enviroment. This will ensure security since the code will only be able to
	"break" the docker container and will not be able to break out of the contianer and influence the external
	enviroment.
	\item A server which will accept the code to be benchmarked and do the above mentioned Dockerisation of the code
	before it is pushed to the execution enviroment.
	\item A web server which will serve the web interface.
	\item A server to expose REST resources which will be used by the web front end to access the backend services
\end{itemize}
