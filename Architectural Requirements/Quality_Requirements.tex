The quality requirements of this product revolve largely around keeping the 
system stable, more specifically the system needs to be able to handle high
amounts of concurrent traffic. The system needs to successfully queue requests
in such a way that no benchmarking request gets lost in high traffic volume. The
product will need a persistent database that will hold user results for a set 
period of time as well as user data and generated test data to be used in the 
future.
