The web services framework is used to expose business services in a
technology-neutral way over some network, which in most cases is the public
Internet.  Wrapping business services in a technology-neutral layer allows
one to decouple the front-end technologies, specifically the user interface
technologies from the back-end technologies, it also allows for the decoupling
of back-end services from one another, in effect communication between dispate
applications.  This decoupling provides one with the ability to vary either the
front-end technologies and back-end technologies independantly from one
another.  Furthmore this allows one to write back-end servies in the most
appropriate technology stack and then have seamless communication between these
indiivdual components.
