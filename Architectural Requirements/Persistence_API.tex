The persistence API provides abstracted access to a persistence provider while
remaing decoupled from the underlying technology, including but not limited to
database, SQL version and transaction management, whilst employing a range of
software engineering tactics to concretely address required quality
requirements required for the peristence domain.

\subsection{Architecture Requirements}
The architectural requirements for the persistence API include the refined
quality requirements and architectural requirements listed below. The
architectural constraints for this lower level components are the same as for
the system as whole, as referred to in 
section \ref{sec:systemArchitecturalConstraints} with further extensions as
specified in section \ref{sec:persistenceAPIArchitecturalConstraints}.
