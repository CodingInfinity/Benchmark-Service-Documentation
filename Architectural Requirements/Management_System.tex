This section specifies the software architecture requirements and the software
architecture design at the second level of granularity - the management service
of the benchmarking system. The management service will be responsible for all
administration of user management, repository management, experiment management
and reporting. The management service will communicate with the client monitor 
applications through the messaging platform. The reader is referred to
figure \ref{fig:managementSoftwareArchitecture} for an overview of the
management platform architecture and requirements. 

\section{Overall Software Architecture}
\subsection{Architecture Requirements}
This section discusses the software architecture requirements around the
back end management system infrastructure. The back end management system will be
responsible for the delegation of jobs to cluster nodes, persisting of results,
user management and allowing users to derive value from reporting. In particular
the architecture requirements at the second level of granularity is specified.

\subsubsection{Access and Integration Requirements}
\label{sec:accessIntegrationRequirementsManagementSystem}
\paragraph*{Access Channels}
The access channels can be divided into two broad categories based on the user type
\begin{itemize}
	\item Human Access Channel
	\item System Access Channel
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph*{Human Access Channel}
\label{sec:humanAccessChannelManagementSystem}
The system will be providing a REST based access channel to be used by human
users via the HTML 5/JavaScript Single Page Application Web Interface.

\subparagraph*{System Access Channel}
The system will expose a further access channel to be used by the so-called
``Benchmark Client" or ``monitor" application. This access channel will be
utilizing a message bus architecture to deliver messages between the client
and the management back end system.

This access channel will however not be accessible to end users.

\paragraph*{Integration Channels}
The various integration channels of the benchmarking system
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integration with a persistence provider.
	\item Integration with the human access channels, namely the web interface.
	\item Integration with the message platform architecture.
\end{itemize}

The integration with the persistence provider is required as we need to persist
the measurements obtained with the benchmarking client. Further more as per the
client's request, test data must also be persisted as it is envision that a
repository of test data will be build.

In order to make the results from the benchmarking tests useful, users will
need some way to interact and manipulate the data in order to be able to
derive value from this data. To enable users to interact with the data,
a web interface will be provided.

The final integration required by the management system is that of integration
with the message platform. In order to better decouple the monitor and
management systems, a messaging architecture was introduced. The management
system will process the results from a queue structure managed by the messaging
system. 

Once a program is uploaded via the a human access channel, it will be deployed
to an autonomous monitor node upon which the benchmarking will commence.  The 
reason for utilizing a messaging architecture is assist in making nodes autonomous
in order to meet the security quality requirements as provided in
section \ref{sec:securityQualityRequirement}.

\subsubsection{Quality Requirements}
\label{sec:qualityRequirementManagementSystem}
The quality requirement are the requirements around the quality attributes of
the systems and the services it provides. This includes requirements like
maintainability, flexibility, extensibility, performance, scalability, security,
auditability, usability and testability requirements.


\paragraph*{Authentication}
The system needs to support a simple registration and authentication framework
which will determine what each user can do based on their authority level.

\paragraph*{Flexibility}
Persistence architectures and reporting infrastructures are rapidly evolving as can
be seen from the rapid growth of NoSQL databases, semantic knowledge repositories and big data
stores. In this context it is important that the application functionality is not locked into any
specific persistence technology and that one is able to easily modify the persistence provider and
reporting framework.

\paragraph*{Testability}
All services offered by the system must be testable through
\begin{enumerate}
	\item automated unit tests testing components in isolation using mock objects, and
	\item automated integration tests where components are integrated within the actual environment.
\end{enumerate}

In either case, these functional tests should verify that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the service is provided if all pre-conditions are met (i.e. that no exception is raised)
	\item the correct exception is thrown when the corresponding pre-condition
	is violated.
	\item that all post-conditions hold true once the service has been provided.
\end{itemize}

In addition to functional testing, the quality requirements should also be tested.

\subsection{Architecture Design}
This section specifies the software architecture design for the second level of 
granularity. It includes the allocation of architectural responsibilities to 
architectural components, any tactics which should be used at the current level
of granularity to address quality requirements,

\subsubsection{Architectural Responsibilities and Components}
Figure \ref{fig:architectureResponsibilityAllocation} shows the allocation of
architectural responsibilities to architectural components.
